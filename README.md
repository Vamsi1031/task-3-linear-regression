# Task 3: Linear Regression

## Objective:
Understand and implement Simple & Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.

## Tools:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Steps Followed:
1. Loaded dataset and selected features and target column.
2. Split data into training and test sets.
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
4. Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
5. Visualized the regression line.

## Output:
- MAE, MSE, and R² printed
- Graph saved as `regression_plot.png`

## Learnings:
- How to build and evaluate a regression model
- Importance of error metrics
- How coefficients explain feature impact
